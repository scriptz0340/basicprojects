# Project Overview

This project allows the user to play rock, paper, scissors against the computer. The user is first prompted to select either 'r', 'p', or 's'. The program will then print your choice along with the computer's choice and whether you won, lost, or tied. Next, the program will ask if you want to keep playing. A 'y' will return a prompt to choose between 'r', 'p', 's' again. A 'n' will terminate the program.

## Key Takeaways

- **Refactoring through modularization** was particularly fascinating and satisfying. Breaking the code into smaller, manageable modules not only made it more readable but also easier to test and maintain.
- This project significantly improved my understanding of **how arguments work**, which was something I had previously struggled with.
- I learned about the **DRY principle** as well.
- I learned how to use the random module with strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

## Reflection

Although I was able to write a functional solution to this problem, I recognize how useful the new techniques and nuances covered in the process will be in future projects. This experience has been valuable in improving my ability to write **functional**, **clean**, **efficient**, and **professional** code.
