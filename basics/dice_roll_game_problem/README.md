# Project Overview

when run, the program will ask the user if they want to roll the dice. If the user says 'y', two random digits (1, 6) are printed. If the user says 'n', a goodbye message is printed and the program terminates.

## Reflection 

- The infinite loop allows the game to continue on forever until user decides to quit.
- At first i thought to break the loop if 'y' but that would cause the program to terminate 
- after one roll instead of allowing user to keep playing.
- I also learned about the 'random' module in python, i didnt know that existed so i 
- couldnt figure out on my own how to generate the random numbers.

- I was able to figure out everything myself except generate the random numbers 
- on my own.


(Solution from course was the same as mine)
