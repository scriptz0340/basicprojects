## Overall:
#      Although i was able to write a functional solution to this problem, I recognize 
#  how useful the new techniques and nuances covered in the solution will be to me in 
#  future projects as i improve my ability to write functional, clean, efficient, and
#  professional code.
#      I really found the refactoring by modularization section particularly fascinating 
#  and satisfying. This project has also helped me to understand how arguments work, 
#  which was something i had been struggling with.
