## I struggled with this one alot and eventually just had to have chatgpt walk me through it.
#  I was able to get the basic skeleton working but i couldn't figure out how to search through the dictionary by number
#  I asked chat gpt to fix my code and explain it to me in depth so i could understand what was working and what wasn't and
#  exactly how to fix it.

## What I leanred:
#  How to search through a dictionary until you find a key with a value matching a specific criteria
#  How to loop through a dictionary (for key, value in dictionary.items():) this allows us to examine both key and value
#  at the same time. Then you can preform your operations based on those iteration variables.
