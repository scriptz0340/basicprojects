## Overview
- Useful study tool for terms and definitions.

## Usage
- Remember to make sure that you have a file in your current working directory that matches the one that the program is trying to access (cd /path/to/file)
- You will be prompted with a list of options:
    1. Add word (if selected you will be prompted to type in a word that will then be added to your wordlist)
    2. Remove word (if selected you will be promted to remove a word from the list by typing it exactly how it is spelled in the list (case-sensitive))
    3. Generate word (Here is where the studying begins. If selected you will be prompted to define a word selected at random from your list)
    4. (q to quit) this will save your current list as is to your wordlist file and quit the program.

## Future
- add ability to store terms with definitions (Dictionary?)
- add ability to check definitions against thos stored in the wordlist file
- add some type of game play aspect like streaks, points, lives, highscore, etc
- add ability to import large files of term-defnition pairs instead of having to add each word individually.
- add different writing challenges, matching challenges, synonym challenges, etc
- Improve overall user experience

## Thoughts
- The program is useful as is and i definitely like it, but having the ability to check definitions locally and receive feedback as you study would be much better than having to double check definitions with the internet or something
