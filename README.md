# My Python Projects 🐍

Welcome to my personal Python learning repository!

This repo is a collection of small projects, exercises, and experiments I've worked on as I learn Python. I'm a beginner programmer and GitHub user, 
and this space is where I track my progress, practice new concepts, and build confidence with the language.

## 📁 Folder Structure

### `/basics/`
This folder contains beginner-level projects and scripts that cover fundamental Python concepts such as:

- Variables and data types
- Input/output
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- Modules and libraries

More folders will be added over time as I explore new topics and take on more advanced projects.

## 💡 Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:

- To document my Python learning journey
- To track my growth as a programmer
- To have a space to try, break, and fix things
- To eventually showcase my progress to future collaborators or employers
